👋 Hi, I’m @benezitta

👀 I’m passionate about discovering new things and constantly expanding my knowledge.

💻 I started studying technology as a self-taught learner, driven by curiosity and the desire to explore how things work behind the scenes.

🎓 I studied Systems Development for 8 months at ETEC de Guarulhos and completed the “Meninas Programadoras” project by USP, led by Professor Maria da Graça, focused on introducing girls and women to programming and encouraging their participation in technology.

🚀 I also participated in the Protagonistas do Futuro program — a project sponsored by The Walt Disney Company, where I learned app creation through block-based programming, combining creativity, logic, and teamwork.

🧭 Currently, I’m pursuing a degree in Business Administration and working at The Walt Disney Company Brazil, where I handle film programming and operational processes in the Theatrical Distribution area.

💞️ I’m deeply committed to empowering women in technology and contributing to a more diverse and inclusive future in the field.
